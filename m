Thanks! Is there a sane way we could make the kernel handle this in
place of the controller?
(It's apparently based on the designware ip, but it doesn't use their
driver for some reason)

That is observed, but I think it is actually more destructive than that.
Attempting to do an access after the fact, then performing a soft
reset results in a spectacular crash when it tries to bring the BIG
cluster online.
