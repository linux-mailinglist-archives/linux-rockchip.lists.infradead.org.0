Keeping allowing a step-by-step approach could be beneficial I think,
in the kernel we also don't require full support for all peripherals on
initial submission ;-) .

And also for people starting out on a specific board having at least partial
support is way easier than trying to figure out for example the vendor
u-boot. =


Maybe we could give this some sort of time limitation like
"binary ddr-init allowed till 2019-10-31" in Kconfig or somewhere
to give people the chance to do things piece by piece but still force them
to actually work on improving the situation.

As driver-side changes will generally benefit more socs/boards potential
removal after the time limit would only affect the board+dts itself.

So somewhat similar to what the kernel does with "staging", if you
keep working on improving it, it is allowed to stay.

This could be also applied to already included boards, like
"give it a working ddr-init till 2019-12-31 or it gets removed", similarly
to how Tom handles devicemanager conversions currently

Hmm, actually I see ddr-init as one of the more difficult parts to achieve
at least if you're not the soc-vendor, due to unavailable documentation
or sources.

A less drastic example would be, submitting a basic devicetree to the
linux kernel without clocks and pinctrl and relying on the things the
bootloader set up for things like uart.
